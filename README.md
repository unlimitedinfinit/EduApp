Here's a step-by-step guide on what to do next:

    Registration Page: Implement the registration process using a backend service (such as Firebase) to store user information securely. You'll need to create fields for user input (e.g., email, password, confirm password) and a button to submit the registration form. Upon successful registration, navigate the user to the Login page.

    Login Page: Implement the login process using the same backend service used for registration. Create fields for user input (email and password) and a button to submit the login form. Upon successful login, navigate the user to the User Profile page or the Survey/Quiz page if the user hasn't completed it yet.

    User Profile Page: Display user information and provide options to edit the profile. You can also include a button to navigate to the Survey/Quiz page or the News Feed/Timeline page.

    Survey/Quiz Page: Implement the survey or quiz with questions related to the user's values and political beliefs. Once the user submits their responses, analyze the answers and save the results to the backend service to generate personalized recommendations.

    Candidate and Issue Information Page: Display relevant information about political candidates and issues based on the user's quiz results. Provide options for the user to learn more about each candidate or issue.

    Budget and Expenditure Data Page: Integrate public data APIs to display budget and expenditure data. Use charts or graphs to visualize the data and make it easy for users to understand.

    News Feed/Timeline Page: Create a news feed displaying the latest news and updates related to the user's interests, political candidates, and issues. Implement filters to help users sort the content according to their preferences.

    Fact-checking Tool Page: Implement a fact-checking tool that allows users to verify the accuracy of information from various sources. You can use APIs from fact-checking organizations or develop your own algorithm to check the credibility of news articles.

    Community Forum/Discussion Board Page: Implement a forum where users can discuss and share their opinions on political candidates and issues. You can use a backend service to store and manage user-generated content.
